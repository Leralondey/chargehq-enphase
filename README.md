# Charge HQ + Enphase + Synology


This simple script allows your to upload your local Enphase Solar Energy data to Charge HQ application. It is an excellent application which allows you to charge your Tesla / EV with your excess solar being generated. App doesn't have direct integration with Enphase thus this script comes in handy. The script has been adapted to be compatible with Synology platforms that do not support the BC command. The BC command has been replaced by the awk command.

**Charge HQ:** https://chargehq.net

**Push API Integration:** https://chargehq.net/kb/push-api

**Enphase:** https://enphase.com/en-au

## Script Details

This script works with v7.x firmware of Enphase which needs login details to generate a JWT token. Although the expiry is long, it should automatically renew token when expired.

**Tested on:**  7.6.172 Enphase + Synology DS218play DSM 7.2.1-69057 Update 4 . Reported working on [Envoy Firmware D8.2.114](https://github.com/khandelwalpiyush/chargehq-enphase/issues/1) as well

It is a shell script which can be run on a DSM 7.2.1-69057 Update 4. Please change the following section


```
# Add Charge HQ api_key and envoy ip below and log_file_path location

api_key=''             # Get this from Charge HQ Application
envoy_username=''      # Your login username for Enphase
envoy_password=''      # Your login password for Enphase
envoy_serial_number='' # Your serial number for Enphase
envoy_local_ip=''      # Your local IP address for Enphase
log_file_path=''       # Log Location - easy for troubleshooting

## To not log simply delete all reference to '>> $log_file_path'

```

Once running, the script will **upload data to Charge HQ every 30 seconds** per their recommendation.
